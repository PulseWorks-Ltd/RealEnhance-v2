const STAGE2_SAFETY_RULES_APPENDIX = `IMPORTANT STAGING SAFETY RULES (MUST FOLLOW):
- Do NOT modify, replace, remove, or reinterpret any fixed fixtures or finishes. Only add removable furniture and décor.
  Fixed fixtures/finishes include (but are not limited to): faucets, sinks, taps, cooktops (gas/electric), ovens, rangehoods,
  light fittings, switches, ceiling fans, built-in cabinetry, wardrobes/closets, doors, windows, frames, tracks,
  flooring materials, wall/ceiling structure, and room geometry.
- Any change to fixed fixtures/finishes is forbidden.

FURNITURE PLACEMENT RULES:
- Furniture that normally sits against a wall (e.g., TV units + TVs, dressers/chests of drawers, wardrobes, desks,
  dressing tables, sideboards/buffets) must ONLY be placed when a full, continuous wall surface is clearly visible
  in the source image where the item will go.
- If wall continuity OR clearance cannot be confidently verified from the image, do NOT place wall-dependent furniture in that area.
- Never block or partially obstruct doors, door swing paths, closet doors, windows, or walkways/circulation paths.

BEDROOM CAUTION:
- Bedrooms are high-risk. Assume closet doors or entry doors may exist outside the visible frame.
- Be conservative in bedrooms: prefer minimal staging (bed, rug, lamps, light décor) over dense layouts.
- Avoid placing dressers/drawers unless the wall is clearly visible and the placement is unquestionably clear.

NO PERSPECTIVE / VISIBILITY CHEATING:
- Do NOT change camera angle, perspective, framing, crop, or architectural visibility to accommodate furniture.
- Do NOT hide/remove architectural elements to justify placement.

STYLE:
- Favor safe, neutral, MLS-appropriate staging over dramatic or “wow” staging.
- If uncertain, stage less rather than risk obstruction or unrealistic placement.`;
