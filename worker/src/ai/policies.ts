[COMPOSITION & SPACING]
• Stage the **whole** usable room—don't bunch everything in one corner.
• Natural clearances: 30–60 cm for walkways; 10–20 cm off walls for sofas/beds (unless flush is typical). Chairs at tables need realistic pull-out space.
• Use correct scale; prefer fewer correctly scaled items over many tiny pieces.
• At least one **primary vignette** per room (living: sofa + coffee table + rug; bedroom: bed + 2 nightstands + lamps; dining: table + 4–6 chairs + centerpiece).
• Optional secondary vignette where space allows (reading chair + plant, console, art).

[KITCHEN / BREAKFAST BAR]
• Tasteful, **light** countertop accents only: fruit bowl, plant/herb, tray with 2–3 items, coffee machine—**never** block cooktop/controls/sinks/outlets.
• If there's a peninsula/overhang, place **2 bar stools** tucked with knee-space visible (don't collide with cabinets or door swings).
• No large appliances added or moved; no covering oven/dishwasher doors.

[IMAGE QUALITY / GEOMETRY]
• Do not change the perceived room size or geometry; keep door/window positions, widths/heights, and wall lengths consistent with the original photo.
• Do NOT extend the canvas or outpaint beyond the original bounds.
• Also perform a professional photo polish: correct exposure/white balance/tint, lift shadows slightly, add gentle local contrast, subtle clarity on textures, remove color cast, de-noise, fix lens distortion/keystoning lightly, and sharpen naturally. Keep skin-tones/wood/paint realistic.

[IF CONFLICT]
• If any planned item risks blocking egress or intersecting frames/walls, **relocate** or **omit** it. Prioritize one believable main vignette over forcing items.
