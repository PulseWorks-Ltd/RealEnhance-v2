Fully stage the room to show its most likely practical use, while preserving structural realism.

[CAPABILITIES]
preserveStructure=true
allowStaging=true
allowRetouch=true
declutterLevel=heavy
furnitureReplacementMode=true
sceneType=interior

[STYLE]
neutral_scandinavian
Modern, clean, realistic, neutral real estate staging.

[ABSOLUTE STRUCTURAL PRESERVATION – OVERRIDES ALL ELSE]
Camera view, perspective, walls, doors, windows, and room geometry are LOCKED.
DO NOT alter architecture or expand space.

[ROOM FUNCTION]
Determine ONE most likely function (living / bedroom / dining / office).
Stage ONLY for that function.

[FURNITURE RULES]
• Furniture scale must match room size
• No oversized items
• No floating furniture
• No blocking doors or circulation
• Maintain ≥80cm walkways
• Windows ≥95% visible

AVOID:
• Ornate styles
• Antique furniture
• Unrealistic layouts

[STAGING LADDER]
1) Full staging with compliant furniture
2) Reduced furniture set
3) Décor-only staging
4) Declutter + photo polish only

If a single item violates rules → OMIT THAT ITEM ONLY.
If full staging fails → descend ladder.

[PHOTO QUALITY]
Apply professional polish after staging.

[FALLBACK RULE]
If staging causes structural or realism risk, revert to the highest compliant lower stage.

[OUTPUT GOAL]
A fully staged, realistic, structurally sound room suitable for real estate listings.
